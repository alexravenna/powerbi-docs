## What you can do with Power BI reports

When you open a report in the Power BI service, you can do more than view it. This documentation covers the following tasks:

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **View reports and dashboards** | Open reports shared with you, view dashboards, and check when data was last refreshed. |
| **Filter and interact** | Use slicers and filters to focus on specific data, sort visuals, and drill down into details. |
| **Ask questions with AI** | Type questions in natural language using Q&A, or use Copilot to summarize content and chat with your data. |
| **Discover insights** | View automatic insights that identify patterns, anomalies, and trends in your data. |
| **Export and share** | Export data or reports to PDF, PowerPoint, or Excel. Set up email subscriptions and alerts. |
| **Personalize your view** | Create bookmarks to save specific views, personalize visuals, and mark favorites for quick access. |

## Get started

If you're new to Power BI, start with these articles:

- [Sign in for the first time](end-user-sign-in.md) - Access the Power BI service and find your content.
- [Get around the Power BI service](end-user-experience.md) - Learn the layout of the Power BI service, including Home, workspaces, and navigation.
- [Find content shared with you](end-user-shared-with-me.md) - Locate reports and dashboards that colleagues shared with you.
- [Apps in Power BI](end-user-apps.md) - Understand how apps bundle related reports and dashboards together.

## Your changes don't affect the original report

When you filter, slice, and interact with reports, your changes don't affect the original content or data:

- **Your changes are personal** - Filters and selections you make only affect your view.
- **Original content is protected** - You can't accidentally modify the underlying report or data.
- **Reset anytime** - Select **Reset** to return to the default view.
