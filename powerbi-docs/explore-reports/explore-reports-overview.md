# Explore reports in Power BI

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-ynnn](../includes/consumer-appliesto-ynnn.md)]

Power BI transforms your organization's data into interactive reports and dashboards that help you make data-driven decisions. Whether you're reviewing sales performance, tracking project metrics, or monitoring key business indicators, Power BI provides the tools you need to explore and understand your data.

## What you can do with Power BI reports

When you open a report in the Power BI service, you can do much more than just view it. Here's an overview of the capabilities covered in this documentation:

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **View reports and dashboards** | Open reports shared with you, view dashboards with key metrics, and check when data was last refreshed. |
| **Filter and interact** | Use slicers and filters to focus on specific data, sort visuals, and drill down into details. |
| **Ask questions with AI** | Type questions in natural language using Q&A, or use Copilot to summarize content and chat with your data. |
| **Discover insights** | Let Power BI automatically find patterns, anomalies, and trends in your data. |
| **Export and share** | Export data or reports to PDF, PowerPoint, or Excel. Set up email subscriptions and alerts. |
| **Personalize your view** | Create bookmarks to save specific views, personalize visuals, and mark favorites for quick access. |

## Get started

If you're new to Power BI, start with these articles:

- [Sign in for the first time](end-user-sign-in.md) - Access the Power BI service and find your content.
- [Get around the Power BI service](end-user-experience.md) - Learn the layout of the Power BI service, including Home, workspaces, and navigation.

## Explore without worry

As you filter, slice, and interact with reports, your changes don't affect the original content or data. Power BI is designed for safe exploration:

- **Your changes are personal** - Filters and selections you make only affect your view.
- **Original content is protected** - You can't accidentally modify the underlying report or data.
- **Reset anytime** - Select **Reset** to return to the default view.
