title: Power BI report exploration documentation
summary: When you're viewing a Power BI report, there are many ways to explore the data beyond just scrolling and reading visuals. This section shows you how to interact with reports—filter, drill, analyze, and customize views—so you can focus on the questions you're trying to answer. If you're new to Power BI or primarily consume shared content, start with the [Power BI for business users documentation](../personas/business-user/index.yml).
